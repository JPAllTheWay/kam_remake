### ![](Readme/GUI_0310.gif) System requirements

- Microsoft Windows or Linux with Wine;
- any dual-core processor;
- 256MB or more of RAM;
- 3D graphics accelerator OpenGL 1.5 compliant

### ![](Readme/GUI_0303.gif) Installation

1. Obtain the original game (Knights and Merchants: The Peasants Rebellion):
	- Installers from original CD and GOG.com should just work.
	- If you bought TPR from Steam, you need to run TPR at least once, otherwise Remake's installer will be unable to detect it.
1. Run the Remake installer and follow the installation instructions.
1. The KaM Remake uses OpenGL for graphics. In case of visual issues or inability to launch the game, visit your graphics card manufacturer site to get the latest drivers available.
1. Launch the mod - KaM_Remake.exe or from the Desktop/Start Menu if you chose to create shortcuts.

### ![](Readme/GUI_0312.gif) Gameplay

#### Multiplayer
To start a game, go to Multiplayer. You can pick any unused server, if you want to start a new lobby, or you can join an existing lobby.

You can also create a local (LAN) server, using "Create server" button.

If you want to create a new dedicated server for our community, see details here: <https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/blob/master/Docs/Readme/technical.md>

#### Keyboard shortcuts
**The following shortcuts are available in the game:**

- **Esc** closes the open message or active tab in the game menu
- **F1-F4** opens corresponding tab in the gameplay menu
- **F5-F8** sets the game speed to x1 / x3 / x6 / x10 (speedup multiplier can be changed in INI file)
- **F11** will show debugging panel and menu
- **1-9** will select units or houses assigned to with Ctrl + 1-9, 0 keys
- **B** will place a beacon on map that your allies can see
- **Spacebar** will center the screen on last placed beacon/message
- **P** pauses the game
- **T** while pressed will show teamnames over units in multiplayer
- **Del** deletes the open message in game
- **←↑→↓** cursor keys will move you around the map
- Scrolling the **Mouse wheel** will zoom in and out
- **←** backspace will reset zoom back to 100%

For more detailed information about game shortcuts please visit our Wiki page:  
<https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/wiki/Controls>

#### Installing add-on maps:
1. Create a sub-folder in the Maps folder of the KaM Remake and name it, for example, "My New Map".
2. Put inside .dat and .map files of the map and rename them accordingly "My New Map.dat" and "My New Map.map". File names should match folder name exactly.
3. You can also make an optional file called "My New Map.txt" which will contain the mission description and other information. Use the same format as the missions provided with the Remake. No official format information will be released because this file will probably be changed later on. 

#### Adding custom music:
You can put your MP3/OGG files into the Music folder of the KaM Remake, and they will be included into the playlist automatically.

# ![](Readme/GUI_0311.gif) Frequently Asked Questions
**Silent crashes:**  
If the KaM Remake crashes silently during startup, please send the log file to contact@kamremake.com along with any other information that might be of use.

**Low framerate:**  
If you have ridiculously low framerate in game it might be because your OpenGL drivers are out of date. See the OpenGL version information in the top-left corner of the main menu, it should be at least 1.5.x. If it is less you need to update your graphics card drivers (check your card manufacturers website).

**Game errors:**  
Sometimes when something unexpected happens you will get an "An error has occurred in the application" message. Please click the Send Bug Report button to send the crash report to us. Enter your name and email address in the form if you would like us to be able to contact you about the crash. Having the crash report will help us to fix the bug.
